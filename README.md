# 🌱 Crop Advisory System

A **machine learning-based Crop Recommendation System** that helps farmers and agricultural experts decide the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and weather conditions.  

This system uses soil macronutrients (N, P, K), climate parameters (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and soil pH to predict the best crop for given conditions.  

---

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Takes **soil nutrient values (N, P, K)** as input  
- ✅ Considers **temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall**  
- ✅ Recommends the **most suitable crop** for the given conditions  
- ✅ Built with **Python & Jupyter Notebook**  
- ✅ Easy to extend with additional parameters or datasets

## 📂 Dataset
The system uses a dataset with the following columns:

| Feature       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **N**         | Nitrogen content in soil |
| **P**         | Phosphorus content in soil |
| **K**         | Potassium content in soil |
| **Temperature** | Temperature in °C |
| **Humidity**  | Relative humidity (%) |
| **pH**        | Soil pH value |
| **Rainfall**  | Rainfall in mm |
| **Label**     | Recommended crop (target variable) |
